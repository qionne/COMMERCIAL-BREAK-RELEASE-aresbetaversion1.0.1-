This is version 1.0.1 of The Ares Platform, known internally as the [COMMERCIAL BREAK RELEASE.] This release features all Day One commercials in a single, uninterrupted loop to allow beta testers to view all currently available channels. The currently available channels are as follows:
• "[as]" by @sunkissedhistory
• "Halfway" by @sunkissedhistory (currently in production)
• "Quieres?" by @sunkissedhistory

As the platform evolves, channels will be replaced and edited. These three channels will be featured at launch, so their smooth execution is the most important feature of this version. Key features to focus on are a consistent framerate, smooth audio playback, and smoother image target tracking.

All questions about this version, the content included in this version, or access to The ARES Platform Beta Program may be forwarded to our Head of Marketing and Design, Mr. Jayson Qionne Edwards, via email at jayson.edwards[at]pensamento.io.
